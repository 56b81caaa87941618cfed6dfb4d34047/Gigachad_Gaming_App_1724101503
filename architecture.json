Additionally, they were asked whether the widget should integrate with a specific crypto wallet or exchange service or function as a generalized solution. \n\nMoreover, the user was provided a checklist of additional features for consideration. Some features included integrating real-time crypto price charts for ScottyCoin, implementing a transaction history feature, and introducing advanced security features.
