The AI provided a checklist of features to consider, such as integrating glassmorphic design elements, dynamic shadows, a pink color scheme, and an interactive tutorial for new users, among others. \n\nThe user made specific requests about the glassmorphic effect and the design of beveled edges and shadows. The AI confirmed it would work on these aspects and also took an additional request to generate an image of a gaming dinosaur with shining bitcoin scales. The AI presented questions regarding the features of a crypto-swapping widget, offering options for automatic or manual conversion rates and whether the widget should integrate with a specific service or be generalized. In response to functionalities such as real-time price charts and wallet connectivity options, the AI confirmed the integration of a Uniswap-style widget, allowing users to swap tokens, including ETH for ScottyCoin. The conversation concluded with the AI asking the user to provide more details about the project.",
