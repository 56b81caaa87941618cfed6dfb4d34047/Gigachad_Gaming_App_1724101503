Additionally, they were asked whether the widget should integrate with a specific crypto wallet or exchange service or function as a generalized solution. \n\nMoreover, the user was provided a checklist of additional features for consideration. Some features included integrating real-time crypto price charts for ScottyCoin, implementing a transaction history feature, and introducing advanced security features. The user confirmed they wanted to integrate real-time price charts, add a 'Favorites' feature, and incorporate wallet connectivity options, while the transaction history and advanced security features remained unchecked.\n\nIn response to the user's request to replace a component with a Uniswap-style crypto swapping widget for purchasing Scotty's Gigachad coin with placeholder tokens, like swapping ETH for ScottyCoin, the AI asked for further details about the project.",
